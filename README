Adding support for submitting our test results to a dashboard is very easy. We
already defined a number of tests for our project in the earlier steps of this
tutorial. We just have to run those tests and submit them to a dashboard. To
include support for dashboards we include the CTest module in our toplevel
CMakeLists file.

# enable dashboard scripting
include (CTest)

We also create a CTestConfig.cmake file where we can specify the name of this
project for the dashboard.

set (CTEST_PROJECT_NAME "Tutorial")

CTest will read in this file when it runs. To create a simple dashboard you can
run CMake on your project, change directory to the binary tree, and then run
ctest â€“D Experimental. The results of your dashboard will be uploaded to
Kitware's public dashboard here.


create a build-directory
For instance :
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
cmake ..
make
and run application
with
./Tutorial number
thest application
make test
or 
ctest -R <name containing in test name>
